# Solitary _Sorry!_

## Project Details

A video of my overview of the project can be viewed here: https://youtu.be/wwUIy7E1RFc

The goal of this project was to recreate the board game _Sorry!_ digitally (following the rules found here: https://www.ultraboardgames.com/sorry/game-rules.php), using Python. Ideally, the software was to allow players to select the color of their pawns, draw cards to move their pawns forward, and be the first player to get all their pawns in their Home.

## Difficulties Faced

The main difficulty with this project was learning and creating classes for the gameplay. Since we didn't spend much time on classes during our lectures, it was a lot of self-learning and trial-and-error to figure out how to create a class, and how to organize my classes and functions to enable gameplay. Due to the intricacy of the gameplay (e.g. there are four players, each with three pawns, and eleven different card types, five of which will require functions to execute) I was unable to create project that can be interacted with.

## What I Learned

I learned how to create classes, and the general organizational structure to do so, through this project. I also learned how to create images to be used for the window background and Turtles.

## What I Enjoyed

I enjoyed learning about how classes worked in Python, as well as recreating the board game's pieces digitally and importing them for use in Python. I also enjoyed figuring out how to organize each piece of gameplay, even if I wasn't successful in creating a working product.

## Next Steps

My next steps will be to finish creating the Board class, which is where I plan to write the functions for gameplay, including having the user interact with the window to draw a card, select a pawn to move, etc. At this time, my main goal is to create a game that has one user playing against three computers, but eventually I would like to set it up where the user can select how many players and how many computers will be playing.
