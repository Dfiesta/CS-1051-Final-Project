Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

So far I have created the classes for the players, pieces, card deck, and board to make the game function. I've also created the images of the board, pawns, and cards to eventually use as the way users will play the game.

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

I have not yet created the functions for the cards that are not just moving pieces forward or backward, or created how the user will interact with the game.

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

My biggest hurdle has been how to set up the classes for each piece of gameplay that makes sense, and having the user play the game.
