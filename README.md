# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Solitary _Sorry!_

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A digital version of the hit board game _Sorry!_ that allows the user to play with their computer.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

Based on the updated Sorry! game (rules can be found here: https://www.ultraboardgames.com/sorry/game-rules.php), my project will be to recreate the gameplay using Python. The software will allow players to select the color of their pawns, draw cards to move their pawns forward, with the goal to be the first player to get all their pawns in their Home. Some features will include a visual board (recreated using Pygame), 3 digital pawns for each color (blue, yellow, green, and red), and 45 digital cards to move the gameplay forward.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

N/A

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

- Establish a turn-based system that draws a random card from the deck for each player after prompt
- Store the board information, including the location of the slide tiles and home tiles for each color
- Enable 2 players to play (user and computer)

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

- Establish a turn-based system that draws a random card from the deck for each player after prompt, and discards the card after the turn
- Enable 2-3 players to play (user and 2 computer)

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

- Create a virtual recreation of the board using turtles to illustrate each player's move

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?
